Foundation-Illustrator-Advanced
=====================

Foundation goodies for Adobe Illustrator: assets library, character and paragraph styles, and a grid template.

This branch will try to maximise Illustrator in-built features like: 
- Color swatches for quick color definition
- Round corners as effects
- Illustrator effect Drop Shadows
- In-built gradients for objects
- All elements will consist as little objects as possible


INSTALLATION
------------
Open foundation-grid.ai in Illustrator and then save as template for later use
